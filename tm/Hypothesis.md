## Hypothesis 

Oliver Ellison, MS SD

Combining the knowledge gained from multiple theories that accurately predict the possibility of time travel, such as closed timelike curves, quantum gravity, quantum entanglement, time dilation, and wormholes, may lead to the development of a functional time machine. By exploring and combining these theories, researchers can develop a deeper understanding of the mechanisms underlying time travel and potentially identify new methods for manipulating spacetime. However, significant technical and practical challenges must be overcome before a functioning time machine can be created, including the development of advanced propulsion and energy systems, the resolution of paradoxes associated with time travel, and ethical considerations surrounding the potential consequences of altering the past.
