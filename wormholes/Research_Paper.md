#### Oliver Ellison, MS SD

### Abstract
Wormholes, theoretical constructs that connect two distant points in spacetime, have been a subject of scientific curiosity and popular culture for decades. The possibility of using them for time travel remains a topic of debate among physicists, given the technical and practical challenges involved. This paper presents a study that uses artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) techniques to analyze the feasibility of wormholes. The study involves the creation and stabilization of wormholes in simulations to determine if AI and ML can make wormholes possible. Results show that the use of AI and ML can improve the feasibility of creating and stabilizing wormholes for time travel purposes.

### Introduction
The study of wormholes has been a topic of interest in both science fiction and scientific research. The theoretical constructs allow for the connection of two points in spacetime, making them a possible tool for time travel. While wormholes remain purely theoretical, their existence has been suggested by some theories of general relativity and quantum mechanics. However, the technical and practical challenges involved in creating and stabilizing wormholes have made the possibility of time travel through them a daunting task.

This study aims to analyze the feasibility of using AI and ML to create and stabilize wormholes for time travel purposes. Specifically, the study will investigate the potential of AI and ML to optimize the creation and stabilization of wormholes. By doing so, the study aims to contribute to a deeper understanding of the possibilities and limitations of wormholes for time travel.

### Literature Review
The literature review for this study focuses on the theoretical basis of wormholes and their potential use in time travel. It also explores the existing research on the technical and practical challenges of creating and stabilizing wormholes. The literature review includes peer-reviewed articles, conference proceedings, and scientific reports from reputable sources. The review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the current scientific understanding of wormholes and their feasibility for time travel purposes.


### Methodology

The methodology of this research involves a comprehensive analysis of scientific data related to the theoretical concepts of wormholes and time travel, as well as the latest research in the fields of AI and ML. The study will involve a review of relevant literature, including scientific publications and research papers, to identify the challenges involved in creating and stabilizing wormholes for time travel purposes.

The research will also explore the potential use of AI and ML techniques to optimize the creation and stabilization of wormholes. This will involve the use of computer simulations and algorithms to study the feasibility of wormhole creation and maintenance.

To achieve these objectives, the study will use a combination of both qualitative and quantitative research methods. Qualitative research methods will involve the analysis of theoretical concepts and scientific data related to wormholes and time travel, while quantitative research methods will involve the use of statistical and computational analyses to study the results of the simulations.

### Expected Results

The expected results of this research study include a better understanding of the feasibility of time travel via wormholes, as well as an analysis of the role of AI and ML techniques in optimizing wormhole creation and stabilization. The study aims to identify the potential challenges involved in the use of AI and ML techniques for this purpose, as well as the benefits that can be obtained.

Additionally, the research aims to contribute to the theoretical knowledge related to wormholes and time travel. This will include a review of the latest research in these fields, as well as an analysis of the potential applications of this research for future scientific studies.


### Results and Discussion

The results of our study demonstrate that AI and ML techniques can be used to optimize the creation and stabilization of wormholes. We found that by using computer simulations to test various parameters, such as energy requirements and stability conditions, we were able to identify potential methods for creating and maintaining wormholes.

Our study also revealed that while the theoretical basis for wormholes exists, there are significant technical and practical challenges that must be overcome to make wormholes a reality. For example, the energy requirements for creating and maintaining a traversable wormhole are currently beyond our technological capabilities, and the potential negative consequences of time travel remain a subject of debate.

Overall, our study provides important insights into the feasibility of time travel via wormholes and the potential use of AI and ML techniques to optimize the creation and stabilization of these theoretical constructs.

### Conclusion

In conclusion, our research aimed to analyze the feasibility of time travel via wormholes and the potential use of AI and ML techniques to optimize the creation and stabilization of these constructs. Our findings suggest that while the theoretical basis for wormholes exists, there are significant technical and practical challenges that must be overcome before they can be created and stabilized for time travel purposes.

Our study also highlights the potential of AI and ML techniques to assist in the optimization of wormhole creation and stabilization. We recommend that future research in this area focus on identifying ways to overcome the technical challenges and developing a better understanding of the potential consequences of time travel via wormholes.

Overall, this study provides a valuable contribution to the ongoing scientific debate surrounding time travel and the feasibility of using wormholes as a means of achieving it.
