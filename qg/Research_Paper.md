## Introduction

Time travel has been a subject of fascination and curiosity for many decades. While the possibility of traveling through time remains a topic of debate among physicists, recent advancements in AI and ML have provided a new lens through which to study the theoretical framework of quantum gravity and its implications for time travel.

Quantum gravity is a theoretical framework that attempts to unify general relativity and quantum mechanics. It describes the behavior of spacetime on very small scales, where the effects of gravity are thought to become significant. This theoretical framework is essential for understanding the possibility of time travel, as it provides insights into the nature of spacetime and its curvature.

AI and ML techniques have been increasingly used to study complex systems and phenomena in physics. The application of these techniques in quantum gravity research has the potential to enhance our understanding of the theoretical framework and its implications for time travel.

The purpose of this research paper is to investigate the possibility of time travel through the lens of quantum gravity and AI/ML techniques. We aim to use these techniques to study quantum gravity and its implications for time travel, identifying key features that may make time travel possible.
