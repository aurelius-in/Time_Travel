This research paper explores the possibility of time travel using closed timelike curves, with a focus on the use of artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques to study the likelihood of such phenomena. The methodology used involves the development and training of machine learning models on datasets of physical and mathematical properties related to closed timelike curves. These models are then used to simulate and predict the behavior of closed timelike curves under various conditions, and to identify any patterns or anomalies that may suggest the possibility of time travel. The results of this study provide valuable insights into the feasibility of time travel using closed timelike curves, and may have implications for the fields of theoretical physics and computer science. Overall, this research paper contributes to the ongoing scientific inquiry into the nature of time and the possibilities of time travel.
