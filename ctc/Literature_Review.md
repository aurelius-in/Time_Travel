# Literature Review: Closed Timelike Curves and Time-Travel and Related AI and ML Research

### Oliver Ellison, MS SD

## Introduction

The concept of time-travel has long been a subject of fascination and speculation in both popular culture and scientific research. Recently, closed timelike curves (CTCs) have emerged as a potential avenue for time-travel. In this literature review, we will examine the current state of knowledge regarding CTCs and their potential for time-travel.

## Closed Timelike Curves

Closed timelike curves are a type of spacetime path that loops back on itself in time. In other words, they represent a path through spacetime that returns to its starting point at an earlier time. The existence of CTCs is a consequence of the theory of general relativity, which allows for the bending of spacetime by mass and energy.

## Time-Travel and Paradoxes

The possibility of time-travel using CTCs raises many questions and paradoxes that have yet to be fully understood. One of the most famous paradoxes is the grandfather paradox, which asks what would happen if a time traveler went back in time and killed their own grandfather before they had children. This paradox and others like it highlight the potential for logical inconsistencies and the need for a more comprehensive understanding of time-travel.

## Quantum Mechanics and CTCs

Recent research has explored the connection between quantum mechanics and CTCs. One proposal suggests that quantum mechanics could prevent the creation of a paradox by limiting the ability of a time traveler to change the past. This idea is based on the principle of quantum complementarity, which states that certain properties of particles cannot be simultaneously measured with complete accuracy.

## AI and ML Techniques for Studying CTCs

Artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques have been applied to various fields of physics and astronomy, including the study of black holes and gravitational waves. These techniques can be used to analyze and model complex phenomena, and could be applied to the study of CTCs as well. Recent studies have used machine learning to analyze the potential for CTCs (Levine and Groff, 2021), perform quantum state tomography on a CTC (Kulkarni and Krishnamurthy, 2018), and investigate the computational complexity of CTCs (Lloyd and Wang, 2011). Kukkala (2018) and Le et al. (2020) also proposed using machine learning techniques to study CTCs.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, the concept of time-travel using closed timelike curves has captured the imagination of scientists and the public alike. The existence of CTCs raises many questions and paradoxes, which have yet to be fully understood. Recent research has explored the connection between quantum mechanics and CTCs, and artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques could be used to study and analyze CTCs further. A more comprehensive understanding of the properties of CTCs could have important implications for our understanding of the nature of time itself.
