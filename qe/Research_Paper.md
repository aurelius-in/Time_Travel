# Investigating the Likelihood of Time-Travel through Quantum Entanglement using AI and ML Techniques

## Abstract

Time-travel has always been a fascinating topic, both in science-fiction and in scientific research. Theoretical physicists have proposed several ideas and models to explain the possibility of time-travel, but none of them have been proven yet. Recent advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques have shown great promise in understanding and modeling complex quantum systems. Quantum entanglement is one of the most intriguing phenomena of quantum mechanics that allows particles to be connected and correlated with each other over long distances. In this study, we investigate the likelihood of the possibility of time-travel through quantum entanglement using AI and ML techniques.

## Introduction

The concept of time-travel has been around for centuries, and it has been a popular topic in science-fiction. The possibility of traveling back and forth in time has always fascinated people, but the question of whether it is actually possible remains unanswered. Theoretical physicists have proposed several ideas and models to explain the possibility of time-travel, but none of them have been proven yet. In recent years, there have been significant advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques that have shown great promise in understanding and modeling complex quantum systems. Quantum entanglement is one of the most intriguing phenomena of quantum mechanics that allows particles to be connected and correlated with each other over long distances. The purpose of this study is to investigate the likelihood of the possibility of time-travel through quantum entanglement using AI and ML techniques.

## Literature Review

To investigate the likelihood of time-travel through quantum entanglement using AI and ML techniques, it is important to review the existing literature on quantum mechanics, quantum entanglement, and time-travel. There have been several theories proposed to explain the possibility of time-travel, including closed timelike curves, quantum gravity, quantum entanglement, time dilation, and wormholes. In this study, we focus on the relationship between quantum entanglement and the possibility of time-travel, and we review the relevant literature on this topic.
