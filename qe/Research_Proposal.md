# Research Proposal: Investigating the Likelihood of Time-Travel through Quantum Entanglement using AI and ML Techniques

## Background and Motivation

The concept of time-travel has always fascinated humans for centuries. The possibility of traveling back and forth in time is not only a popular topic in science-fiction but also in real scientific research. Theoretical physicists have proposed several ideas and models to explain the possibility of time-travel, but none of them have been proven yet.

Quantum entanglement is one of the most intriguing phenomena of quantum mechanics that allows particles to be connected and correlated with each other over long distances. Recent advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques have shown great promise in understanding and modeling complex quantum systems. 

The purpose of this research is to investigate the likelihood of the possibility of time-travel through quantum entanglement using AI and ML techniques.
